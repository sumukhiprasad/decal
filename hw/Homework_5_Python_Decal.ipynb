      "\u001b[0;31mAttributeError\u001b[0m: module 'numpy' has no attribute 'str'.\n`np.str` was a deprecated alias for the builtin `str`. To avoid this error in existing code, use `str` by itself. Doing this will not modify any behavior and is safe. If you specifically wanted the numpy scalar type, use `np.str_` here.\nThe aliases was originally deprecated in NumPy 1.20; for more details and guidance see the original release note at:\n    https://numpy.org/devdocs/release/1.20.0-notes.html#deprecations"
